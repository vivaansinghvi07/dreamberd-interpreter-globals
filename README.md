# Dreamberd Interpreter Globals

Due to a security vulnerability pointed out [here](https://github.com/vivaansinghvi07/dreamberd-interpreter/issues/20), the workflow dealing with issues has been temporarily disabled. It will be back up and running when the issue is fixed.

Stores global variables for my DreamBerd interpreter, visible [here](https://github.com/vivaansinghvi07/dreamberd-interpreter). Create any issues that pertain to this repository in the linked interpreter repository, or I may not see them in a timely manner.
